Chance of sending at least x to a front is piecewise linear?
look at moments to determine of it is piecewise linear
compute second moment as high as possible
find smallest rational approximation of moments

run for seven fronts and see if we get 2/7

different solvers for cxvpy





Possible conjectures to prove:
-One front <=2/5
-Two fronts <=4/5
-If one front gets 2/5 troops, how large can the second largest be
-Shape of 2D distribution
-AS a function of x,y f(x,y)=chance p1 wins fronts 1 and 2 if p1 sends x to the two fronts and p2 sends y total to the two fronts


Pure strategies that defeat uniform distribution strategy:
	2K+1 fronts
	K fronts 0
	a fronts (2k-1)/2k or 3/k(2k+1)
	K+1-a fronts 2/2k+1

Add distribution pictures using random sampling technique
Improtant feature is that its uniform in each direction
