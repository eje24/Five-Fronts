ALL PARTITIONS CONSIDERED
Probability that >T troops are sent to a front for various N
All partitions are considered for optimal mixed strategies


a front for N= 5
T= 0   -->  1.0
T= 1   -->  1.0
T= 2   -->  0.4
T= 3   -->  0.0
T= 4   -->  0.0

a front for N= 10
T= 0   -->  1.0
T= 1   -->  0.8
T= 2   -->  0.647
T= 3   -->  0.4
T= 4   -->  0.301
T= 5   -->  0.0
T= 6   -->  -0.0
T= 7   -->  -0.0
T= 8   -->  -0.0
T= 9   -->  -0.0

a front for N= 15
T= 6   -->  0.199
T= 7   -->  0.0

a front for N= 25
T= 10   -->  0.132
T= 11   -->  0.0

a front for N= 30
T= 12   -->  0.121
T= 13   -->  0.003


ONLY "SMALL" PARTITIONS CONSIDERED
Only partitions with maximal element at most N/2 are considered
These partititions have never appeared with positive probabiity anyway
